This is the client order manger app.

The client will recive orders from the server and display them, then the user will make the dish and once it is done the dish
component shall be dragged to one of the free panels.

We are going to use websockets to connect to the server and get the orders from it.

Current design supports up to 5 orders at once with 6 out panels.

TODO:
1. Add drag and drop option to the orders into the panels. V
2. Add login to the server as a specific role. (bar/kithcen).
    Functionality works. V
    Needs to add a choosing role page.

Occupied panels will be marked with red.
